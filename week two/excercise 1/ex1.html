    <h1>IBM founder Thomas J. Watson</h1>
    <p>
        Thomas John Watson Sr., an American businessman who was born on February 17, 1874, served as chairman and CEO of IBM from the time of his appointment until his death on June 19, 1956. From 1914 through 1956, he played a part in the growth of the business into a growing force. Watson was influenced by John Henry Patterson's education at NCR while developing IBM's management philosophy and organizational culture. He changed the company into a very effective sales organization that depended primarily on punched card tabulating machinery. He was hailed as the greatest salesman in history and was a well-known self-made manufacturer who passed away in 1956. He was also among the wealthiest persons in his time.
